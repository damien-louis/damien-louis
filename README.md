### Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm Damien, french developer. In love with PHP and Symfony from many years.

***

âœ¨ You can discover (and git clone or fork, of course) my repository [Symfony Docker](https://github.com/damien-louis/symfony-docker), a quick way to install locally the latest Symfony version with an optimized Docker configuration (Caddy, PHP, Postgres).  This repo is delivery with QA and tests tools an awesome Makefile to simplify the setup, the config and execution of differents tools.

âœ¨ You also can use my two Docker repositories : 
- PHP : https://hub.docker.com/r/dmnlouis/php
- Caddy : https://hub.docker.com/r/dmnlouis/caddy
